# Kingdom Hearts IV unoficial site

This is a project that I wanted to do for a long time. The truth is, I procastinated for a few months for various reasons until I finally decided to be fully commited to this for a couple of weeks. In a way, as of January 2025 I've been lucky because KH4 hasn't been re-announced last year neither at Summer Games Fest, Tokyo Game Show or The Game Awards. If that was the case, I'm sure there would be an official website by now and this project would have made a little less sense. That said, I really wish Square Enix releases a new Kingdom Hearts IV trailer sooner than later. It's been almost 3 years and we fans deserve it. I'm sure it will end up being an amazing game and all this waiting will be worth in the end. Maybe at the Switch 2 reveal event? We'll see.

This site is built using with HTML, CSS and Typescript. As a framework, I used the old and realiable React. The goal with this project wasn't really to improve my React and JS skills, but rather practice on UX design and trying new things. As a result, even if this was my first project and there are some aspect I think I can improve over time. I had so much fun while doing it.

I expect to update this site as soon as there are any news such as trailers, screenshots, worlds, characters or anything worth sharing.

May your heart be your guiding key ðŸ©µ

PS: There is an easter egg hidden somewhere in this site. Hint: it's something related with DARKNESS ;)
